# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: 3 January 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
I revamped my personal website and got it set up using Amazon Web Services, along with a few other websites I created and maintain.

**Thoughts**
I've been on a bit of a hiatus, but I am ready to go full steam ahead with coding. I'm excited to document #100DaysOfCode along with my own personal goal of #1000HoursOfCode which I started before I knew anything about this challenge.  My primary goal is to be working as a developer by the end of June.  This challenge will help me build and showcase a portfolio to show to prospective employers.  I wish everyone participating in this challenge good luck, and would especially like to thank my best friend and mentor @StephenGFriend, for being a consistent source of support and motivation!
