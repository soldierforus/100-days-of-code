# 100 Days Of Code - Log



### Day 1
3 January 2017, Tuesday
###_____________________________________________________________________________


**Today's Progress**:
I revamped my personal website and got it set up using Amazon Web Services, along with a few other websites I created and maintain.

**Thoughts**
I've been on a bit of a hiatus, but I am ready to go full steam ahead with coding. I'm excited to document #100DaysOfCode along with my own personal goal of #1000HoursOfCode which I started before I knew anything about this challenge.  My primary goal is to be working as a developer by the end of June.  This challenge will help me build and showcase a portfolio to show to prospective employers.  I wish everyone participating in this challenge good luck, and would especially like to thank my best friend and mentor @StephenGFriend, for being a consistent source of support and motivation!

### Day 2
4 January 2017, Wednesday
###_____________________________________________________________________________

**Today's Progress**:
Today I made some minor changes on other websites for other organizations I run, and got them hosted and served through Amazon Web Services.  I also made some changes to my time logger [1000hours] fixing a bug that allowed minutes to show more than 59.  Began work on an I/o function so time logger cannot be stopped twice in a row.

TIL about:
flow - https://flowtype.org/ - A STATIC TYPE CHECKER FOR JAVASCRIPT
nuclide - https://nuclide.io/  - A unified developer experience for web and mobile development#
Nuclide is built as a single package on top of Atom to provide hackability and the support of an active community. It provides a first-class development environment for React Native, Hack and Flow projects.
eslint - http://eslint.org/ - The pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX

I was inspired to make my nodeJS apps a little more consistent with double quotes, semi-colons, spacing, and to adhere to accepted styling practices in general for my code using these new tools.

**Thoughts**
Tomorrow I will work on creating a website for my friend's music group.

### Day 3
5 January 2017, Thursday
###_____________________________________________________________________________

**Today's Progress**:
Today I discovered many more bugs in my time logger, added to Next Up ideas to improve in the Next Up Section.  

I worked on my friends' website for their music group & got it hosted on github pages with their domain name.

I also started the Javascript 30 day challenge. https://javascript30.com/


**TIL**
flow - https://flowtype.org/ - A STATIC TYPE CHECKER FOR JAVASCRIPT.  I went through some of the getting started workflows, and added / @flow to some of my projects and ran npm run-script file.js to see what errors flow came up with.


**Next Up**
[1000hours] More bugs found.  I think these may be problems with the none-persist module  I want a more robust time logger anyways so I can produce visual data for time tracked using dates (eg weekly/monthly averages etc).  Remove files from github.  Create new feature branch.

[Personal Website] I discovered the collapsed menu bar on my website is not functional; need to diagnose and fix. Remove files from github.  Create new feature branch.

[TalkSick.Space] - More work on my friends website.
